            <p class="para">My fears are not written in order but I will admit this one I do not think about often. I have a genuine fear of
            low flying birds.Why you ask? Well I'll tell you, birds have these arrowheads built into their faces that penetrate 
            your eye with unforgiving brutality! I mean have you seen the force those things hit windows
            with!? Not in my face!!! And yes I know they fly into 
            them because they cant tell the glass 
            but trusting there dissernment with the size I know their brains are is a hard ask.</p>

            <p class="para">A plane dropping on me is one I consider more practical than the first
            one. This fear started when I watched an episode of Air Crash Investigation about a 
            plane that had crashed after a bad take off and it landed on a bridge then felll into the river below.
            thing is when it crashed it was during a blizzard and there was heavy traffic on the bridge, it landed on about 5 cars 
            all instantly flattened and you can imagine what happened to the passengers. The thought of it is what gets me, I imagine
            in one car they were probably mid conversation, talking about how this was going to take forever to clear up,
            finding something decent on the radio to kill time then boom... they are suddenly in a white room dressed in white robes or something
            not knowing what just happened(I'm just assuming we get a change of clothes when we die). I'm not sure but i think
            i'd like to see it coming... I dont know though, ask me after it happens.</p>

          <h2 id="h2">Brain?</h2>
            <p class="para">The third and final one is having an unraptured anuerysm, just the thought of walking around with
            a ticking time boom in my head, knowing any bump on the head or an especially hard sneeze or laughing 
            spell could set it of!  </p>
